# Scheduler
Scheduler backend development using python. Finished the backend work for the scheduler sheet. Will have to work on implementing a server for multiple connections and the issue of multiple commands coming in at once. I also want to develop a connection to google drive to maintain a longer term data base for accessing perhaps years worth of data. 

- make a server 
- connect to google drive 
- create a gui for the scheduler 
- make a json file conversion for the sheet and vice versa
