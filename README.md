# Scheduler
Scheduler backend development using python. Finished the backend work for the scheduler sheet. Will have to work on implementing a server for multiple connections and the issue of multiple commands coming in at once. I also want to develop a connection to google drive to maintain a longer term data base for accessing perhaps years worth of data. 

- make a server 
- connect to google drive 
- create a gui for the scheduler 
- create a backend for getting the total price from a sheet/json 
- modify the customer class such that you can split it into multiple customers with the same attributes except for the fact that the list of services have been split 
- not sure if the extra attribute of whether the customer has been received is needed or not as if they did not come then the customer can be deleted from the sheet
